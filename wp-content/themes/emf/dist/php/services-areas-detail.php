                                    <p>Residential lighting is arguably as important to a home’s aesthetics as any other design element.
                                        Changing the lighting in a particular room can often change the room’s entire ambiance. A home
                                        owner can take control of their lighting’s appearance – and its efficiency – by using controls and
                                        dimmers that are a bit more advanced than a simple on-off switch.
